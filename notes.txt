there are already methods to execute sql via string input
there is also an outline of the main menu 
there is also an outline of the function declarations given 

idea for registration:
* check if username exists 
    - if not then update the users table with their relevant information
    - if exists, then output a warning and send back to main menu or registration prompt 

plan: 
* executeUpdate is the function to use for input to user table 

how to assess boolean of user existing? 
    * executequery and use the row count > 0 to assess existing username

Test existing check via INSERT dummydata, then input dummy username, shouldnt allow 
Test update via creating new user and then trying to register with credentials + SQL query check
