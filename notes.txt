there are already methods to execute sql via string input
there is also an outline of the main menu 
there is also an outline of the function declarations given 

idea for registration:
* check if username exists 
    - if not then update the users table with their relevant information
    - if exists, then output a warning and send back to main menu or registration prompt 

plan: 
* executeUpdate is the function to use for input to user table 


how to test this? have to configure first I am guessing
